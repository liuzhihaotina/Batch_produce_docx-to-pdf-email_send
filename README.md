Written on the front
1. Code function: One of the school summer camp pre-promotion and exemption volunteer activities--according to the list of grades and the emails from one excel file and the two docx templates, batch generate docx files and convert them to pdf, and then send emails with a specific email account with one click.
2. Code modification: Some improvements have been made according to the existing code, and I am now sending it to github. I hope it will be helpful to you.
3. Note: The document notes, etc. are all in Chinese. Hopefully you can read them.

How to run (To see this in Chinese version in README0.txt)
1. Firstly, make sure that you enter your data (pay attention to the path where it is stored): an excel with grades and mails list, the docx templates.
2. Then you should modify the codes according to your needs, especially the paths, majors, docx templates and the information of the sender Email account.
3. Run the two .py files in the Docx folder in order (generate docx; convert to PDF).
4. Run the main.py in the HITMail folder and then it can send the emails in seconds!
